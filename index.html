        Hello,
      </div>
      <br>
      <div style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-size: medium">
        I am Kavinda Herath currently pursuing MSc. in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I was born in Sri lanka
        and grew up in Kurunegala. I attended the Royal International School in Kurunegala from the Nursery until Ordinary Level exam. 
        In school, I served as the president of 
        student association for one year and served as a senior prefect in the school. Further I was a member in college swimming squad and participated in several 
        extracurricular activities.
        After succesfully passing the G.C.E O/L exam I moved to the high school, St. Anne's college Kurunegala. In high school, I was a member in the english 
        debating club. I did my G.C.E. Advance Level exam in Physical Stream and sucessfully passed it.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-size: medium">
        I moved to Italy, Turin order to follow my passion in mechanical engineering. I obtained Bachelor of scienece in Mechanical Engineering from Politecnico di 
        Torino. During my bachelor, I did a exchange program to University of Arkansas in United States of America and completed it with a GPA of 4.0/4.0. I also served as a 
        member of student team 
        <a style="color:#f0070d" href="https://glideteampolito.wixsite.com/ilmiosito/">R.G. Glide polito team</a>. I did an experimental thesis for my bachelor titled 'The mechanical properties of natural fiber and a case study of
        Coconut fibers'. In above thesis, I was testing the possibilty of using extracted coconut fibers to make biocomposite materials, resistant to cold and wet condition.

      <br>
      <div style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-size: medium">
        I enrolled into Politecnico di Milano to pursue my Master's. In PoliMi, I particpated in the programme of passion in action and earned a open bage in bioinspired 
        robotics. I participated in the 20/21 erasmus program in Brno university of technology and succefully completed. Currently, I am working on my master thesis on design, 
        implementation and control of bioinspired snake like acquatic robot. I am expecting to graduate in 2021. And my future interest is to work in the fields of Robotics, mechatronic 
        and dynamics engineering.
